# Software Testing Concepts

This document summarizes the key concepts discussed in two videos related to software testing: Test Coverage and Factories & Fakes.

## Video 1: Test Coverage

This video explains the importance of test coverage in software development.

### Key Takeaways:

* **Importance of Test Coverage:** High test coverage provides confidence that a large amount of the codebase has been executed during testing, increasing the likelihood that the code works as expected.
* **Using Test Coverage Reports:** Test coverage reports show which lines of code were executed during tests and, more importantly, which lines were not. This information helps developers identify areas needing more test cases.
* **Increasing Test Coverage:** By examining the "missing" lines in coverage reports, developers can write targeted test cases to cover those specific parts of the code. Testing both "happy" paths (normal execution) and "sad" paths (error conditions, edge cases) is crucial for achieving high coverage.
* **Continued Testing at 100% Coverage:** Even with 100% test coverage (all lines of code executed), bugs can still exist. This is because tests might only cover known good data, and unexpected input or scenarios can still reveal issues. Therefore, continuous testing with various inputs and edge cases is essential.

## Video 2: Factories and Fakes

This video discusses the use of factories and fakes in software testing to create realistic test data.

### Key Takeaways:

* **Need for Factories and Fakes:** When testing, it's often necessary to have large amounts of realistic data or to simulate the behavior of dependencies without relying on the actual implementations. Factories and fakes provide a solution for this.
* **Factories to Generate Fakes:** Factories are used to create fake objects (fakes) with realistic-looking data. This is especially useful when dealing with data models or complex objects that require many attributes. Libraries like FactoryBoy (in Python) help define how these fake objects should be generated with plausible data (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers).
* **Testing Against Fakes:** Fakes generated by factories can be used in unit tests as stand-ins for real objects. These fakes often mimic the behavior of the real objects, allowing developers to test the logic of their code in isolation without depending on external systems or complex setup. Any method call that can be made on the real object can typically also be made on the fake object.

```java
// TestCoverageExample.java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int divide(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
        return a / b;
    }
}
