# Test Driven Development (TDD) Overview

## What is TDD?
Test Driven Development means writing unit test cases before the actual code. These tests guide the design of your code and ensure it behaves as expected.

## Red/Green/Refactor Workflow
1. **Red** – Write a failing test for the desired functionality.
2. **Green** – Write just enough code to pass the test.
3. **Refactor** – Clean up the code while keeping tests green.

## Why Use TDD?
- Keeps development customer-focused
- Helps catch bugs early
- Simplifies future code changes
- Forms the backbone of CI/CD pipelines
- Reduces time spent debugging

## TDD in DevOps
Automated tests are crucial for effective CI/CD. Without test automation, pipelines can’t safely deliver software at high speed.
